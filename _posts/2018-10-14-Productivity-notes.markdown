# My way to productivity

## Plan tasks
* If possible, plan in advance
* Set at least 3 tasks for each day

## Tasks
### Good task
* Don't scare away
* Is well defined
* Can be accomplished
* It's easy to understand when it's done
* Has a deadline

### Starting
* Write down each task before starting it
* Have a system with 3 stages at minimum: a (prioritised) backlog, in progress and done. Optionally it's good to have "notified" stage when the results need to be announced.

### Sizes
* Each task should be of reasonable sizes where it can be taken at maximum within 1h
* If a task is too big try to divide it into smaller tasks, e.g. reading/writing can be in sections, code writing in functionality.

### Finishes
* It should be possible to accomplish a task. Don't take something that's beyond skills, or takes significant amount of time. In such cases these should be 'long term goals'.
* Deadline puts a pressure on actually accomplish a task. Only accomplished task provides satisfaction; other tasks are just lingering and demotivating.

## Day planning
* Start a day with important or postponed tasks, so that it feels like a quick progress once it's finished. 
* Block windows of time for uninterrupted work

* Have some time for physical exercises. Don't have to be every day but you need to relax
* Have some idle brain time.

## Executing tasks
* Make sure you have everything to accomplish the task
* Make sure you won't be disturbed at least for the expected half of duration

# Loose notes
## Know yourself
Figure out when you work the best. That might be in a crowded cafe where everyone can see you working and you don't want to be noticed not working, or in quite place in home where no one can bother you.

## Pareto
About 20% of our tasks can fulfil for about 80% of the load.

## Skills
Some tasks are above our current skills. If we are expecting to perform similar task in the future, and that task is important, then it might be beneficial to invest some time and improve these skills first.

## Multi-tasking
Don't multi-task. Unless it's something that naturally can be done in parallel, e.g. ironing and calling, tasks should be taken one at a time with full attention. Switching mental context takes time and you'll waste time on jumping between. It might be that some tasks take time because you're waiting for others, but then you should put these tasks into "blocked" stage and take onto another one.
